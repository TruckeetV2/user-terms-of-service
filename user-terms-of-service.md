### 1. Contractual Relationship.
These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern the access or use by you, an individual of the Services (defined below). PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY BEFORE ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICES.

Truckeet is an on-demand lead generation service that enables users to connect with delivery providers to seek, receive and fulfill requests for delivery services (the “Services”). Your access and use of the Services constitute your agreement to be bound by these Terms, which establishes a contractual relationship between you and Truckeet. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or use the Services. Truckeet may immediately terminate these Terms or any Services with respect to you, or generally cease offering or deny access to the Services or any portion thereof, at any time for any reason. Truckeet may at times enter into a separate Merchant Services Agreement with business entities that refer or otherwise use the Services (“Partner”). For any conflicts between this Truckeet User Agreement and the Merchant Services Agreement, the Merchant Services Agreement will take precedence over the Truckeet User Agreement.
